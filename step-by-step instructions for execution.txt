Step-by-step instructions to run the project.

1. Create a Java GUI application in NetBeans, Eclipse, or
any IDE of your choice, using the Java code contained within
Frame1.java and the XML code contained within Frame1.form. If you don't know 
how to create a Java GUI application, refer to some tutorials or other videos 
on Youtube or Google.
Now in the code contained in Frame1.java, you will find these different 
file paths at various places:

a. E://ProjectResults//naivesbayes.txt
b. E://ProjectResults//j48.txt
c. E://ProjectResults//smoreg_values.txt
d. E://ProjectResults//smoreg_accuracy.txt

There are some more file paths, but I'll come to that later.

Now create a folder on your desktop, and give it a name, eg. ABC.
Now copy the path of folder ABC, and replace it with these paths above.

Suppose the path of folder ABC is C:/Desktop/ABC, then replace all the 4 links above as 
follows:

Replace a. with C://Desktop//ABC//naivesbayes.txt
Replace b. with C://Desktop//ABC//j48.txt
Replace c. with C://Desktop//ABC//smoreg_values.txt
Replace d. with C://Desktop//ABC//smoreg_accuracy.txt

Note: You don't have to create the files naivesbayes.txt, j48.txt, etc. in ABC. They will be created automatically
by your Java code.

Next, download and install Selenium WebDriver, Chromedriver, and Weka, which are some softwares, and copy and add their .jar files into the libraries 
folder in your NetBeans project. To know how to do this, google it up, there are lots of videos showing you how to add external
.jar files to your NetBeans project.


Now, create a folder XYZ in your desktop. Inside it, move the chromedriver.exe that you just downloaded. Now, replace this statement
in the Java code : System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver","E:\\store1\\chromedriver.exe");, with this:
System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver","C:\\Desktop\\XYZ\\chromedriver.exe"); 

Do not run your Java code yet.


2. Copy the code given in code.txt into a text editor of your 
choice or a notepad file and save it as an HTML file, maimap.html, inside the ABC folder.
(Note: Just copy the code into a text editor and save it as
an HTML file. But please, DO NOT input 
any values into the text boxes that get displayed in this HTML 
file AT ALL. Just save it and keep it.)

Now in your Java code, find the place where you have this path : file:///E:/ProjectResults/mainmap.html
and replace it with this: file:///C:/Desktop/ABC/mainmap.html or the path of the mainmap.html file obtained by right clicking on the mainmap.html file and going into 'properties', (whichever works)

3. Copy the text of .arff files given, intest2.arff, intrain2.arff, FTrain1.arff, FTest1.arff, into 4 different notepad files respectively, and save each of them as an .arff file
in the ABC folder.
Each of their paths should read like : C:/Desktop/ABC/intest2.arff, like this.

4. Now, in order to see how the Java code is run, go to 
(Note: Folder names and file names are changed in the video, so keep your eyes and brains open while watching the video.)
